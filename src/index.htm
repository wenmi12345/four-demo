    <h2>THIS IS A SECTION ABOUT PHYSICIAN</h2>
    <p>
      A physician (American English), medical practitioner (Commonwealth
      English), medical doctor, or simply doctor, is a health professional who
      practices medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining or
      restoring health through the study, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of
      disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. Physicians may
      focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients, and
      methods of treatment—known as specialities—or they may assume
      responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical
      care to individuals, families, and communities—known as general
      practice.[2] Medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge
      of the academic disciplines, such as anatomy and physiology, underlying
      diseases and their treatment—the science of medicine—and also a decent
      competence in its applied practice—the art or craft of medicine

    <h2>Specialist in internal medicine</h2>
    <p>
      Around the world the term physician refers to a specialist in internal
      medicine or one of its many sub-specialties (especially as opposed to a
      specialist in surgery). This meaning of physician conveys a sense of
      expertise in treatment by drugs or medications, rather than by the
      procedures of surgeons.
      <br />
      This term is at least nine hundred years old in English: physicians and
      surgeons were once members of separate professions, and traditionally were
      rivals. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, third edition, gives a
      Middle English quotation making this contrast, from as early as 1400: "O
      Lord, whi is it so greet difference betwixe a cirugian and a physician.
